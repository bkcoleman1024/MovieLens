## Overview

User ratings and other movie information was analyzed to produce recommendations for new and existing users.

## Business Problem

With so many options for users, providing the best possible recommendations for an individual may keep them with a particular service.  

## Data

![RT_ratings](images/RT_ratings.jpeg)

The data is from movielens.org.  The smaller dataset was used.  The dataset gave information on 610 users and 9,742 movies.  The users rated at least 20 movies.

## Methods

This project tested several models.  The final model was the one that provided the greatest accruacy on predicting a user's rating of a movie.

## Results

The SVD model was the best option.  

The movies with the largest budgets have established franchises and fanbases.  These movies were the most recent Star Wars movies and Avengers movies.

After reviewing the movies with the greatest ROI over the last 5-20 years, movies that can be classified as horror have some of the best returns.  


## Conclusions and next steps

The smaller dataset was used for this project.

How is the film marketed?

Build off of user feedback. Use this to reach the target audience.
